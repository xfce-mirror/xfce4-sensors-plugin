TODO
======

- Use notfication messages when alert is on; when maximum is reached.

- fix error: doesn't find all sensors when newly adding plugin to panel - sensors library problem?

- read acpi fan state?

- switch to sysfs completely for everything?

- decrease size of entries in min/max value fields... would have to change renderer for double values...


Known bugs or user requests
---------------------------
- enumerate sensors from libsensors in an arbitrary fashion so that the order in which libsensors delivers them does no longer matter

- common settings for both application and plugin wrt. sensor names etc.

Plans
-----
- use D-bus to send messages with new settings from xfce4-sensors application to panel plugin

- have someone implement kde and gnome plugins based on library/API

- have someone implement some BSD backends and integrate them into project
