Preparation: Install libsensors, lmsensors, hddtemp, xnvctrl
             for lmsensors do:
             sensors-detect as root somehow, have modules be added to config files, let them be loaded or load them manually or do some sudo service moduleinit-tools restart or the like
             and then install.

Installation: ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

Theming: You can put a customized style file globally under 
         /usr/local/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce4-sensors-plugin.css 
         or locally under $HOME/.config/xfce4/panel/xfce4-sensors-plugin.css.
         This might be especially useful for distributions.
